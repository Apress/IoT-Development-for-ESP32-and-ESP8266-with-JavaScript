Do you have questions about an example or a concept discussed in the book? Feel free to ask us here! If you have a question about the Moddable SDK, please open an issue in the [Moddable SDK repository](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/).

You can also ping us in the Moddable [chatroom on Gitter](https://gitter.im/embedded-javascript/moddable). This is a great option if you have a project you'd like to talk about or want to have a longer discussion.
